## about

**belphegor** is a simple to use C++ graphics engine built on a modern standard (C++23) and using the experimental C++ module system. It is inspired by what I feel is a lack of anything as simple to use as pygame/pyglet/LÖVE/etc.

It is _not_ a fully-fledged game engine, nor is it intended to bem but one could be written on top of it.

## philosophy

This project is intended primarily as a fun toy for me to play around with, I anticipate things will break/crash/explode wildly. If you check this repo out and notice something is broken, feel free to create an issue, and if/when I have time I will try and get to it.

There is no guarantee I will not completely break old code either, the API will likely never be considered stable.

## name

It's sick as hell, and has a neat bit of iconography associated with it (upside-down π).
